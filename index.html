      <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    
      
      <p> I am a physics and computer science teacher based in New York City. I believe wholeheartedly in project-based
        learning and in increasing access to STEM education, especially for young women and students who have
        historically been excluded from these fields. As a student at Relay Graduate School of Education, I am currently
        working towards my Master of Arts in Teaching, where I focus on inclusive and culturally responsive curriculum
        development.
      </p>
      <p> I completed my undergraduate degree at Wellesley College, graduating in 2020 summa cum laude with a bachelor's
        degree in physics and a minor in astronomy. While there, I worked in several different labs, jumping around from
        particle physics to quantum optics to a brief stint in materials science. But my heart always belonged in
        education. As I learned more and more about the fields I loved, I felt more and more strongly that I wanted to
        share my love of physics with the next generation. </p>
